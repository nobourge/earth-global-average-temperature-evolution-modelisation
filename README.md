# Global Temperature Modeling (INFO-F305)

## Project Overview
This repository contains our work for the INFO-F305 course, focused on modeling and simulation of the global average temperature evolution. The project involves the development and analysis of various energy balance models (EBMs) to simulate and understand the changes in Earth's temperature.

## Models
We explore several models in this project:
- Basic Energy Balance Model (EBM)
- EBM with varying albedo
- EBM considering emissivity
- EBM with temperature-dependent Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR)
- EBM with temperature-dependent albedo

## Simulation
Simulations are conducted using Octave, with the `ode45` function for solving differential equations. The results are analyzed to understand the stability and impact of different factors on the Earth's temperature.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains Octave scripts for the simulations.
- `data/`: Includes data files used or generated by the simulations.
- `docs/`: Contains the LaTeX source files for our report.

## Running the Simulations
Instructions on how to set up the environment and run the simulations.
